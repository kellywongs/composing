		<h3 id="introduction-preface">a. Preface</h3>

		<div class="chonk">
			<p>
			<b>First of all,</b> I’d like to extend my dearest condolences to anyone who happens upon this manual. It may be too abstract for the seeker of practical knowledge; it may be too preoccupied with the strings for use of those from the concert band sphere.<a class="source" alt="Hindemith had a whole thing about who wouldn’t like his book. It took like three pages and was overall just So Many more words than I really wanted to read about his specific target audience.">[1]</a> To avoid losing anyone, I’ll do my best to tread the line between enthusiastically expounding on a topic and drowning in poeticisms. This should ultimately be accessible to all audiences, regardless of previous musical knowledge or any predisposition towards a certain instrument grouping.
			</p>
			<p>
			There are two general audiences whose presence I anticipate, and still more who I will not, so my prefaces will be allocated thusly:
			</p>
			<p>
			<i>In the event</i> that you’re my hypothetical target audience, a student musician who’s recently caught The Arranging Bug: you’re in the right place! This manual is meant to explicate my perception of the intricacies of orchestration and my personal process of turning others’ art into your own. I’ve written down tricks I’ve picked up about typesetting music, coming up with tempo markings, and recruiting musicians to play your piece. My only authority rests on the couple of pieces<a class="source" alt="6!">[2]</a> I’ve written for CHS ensembles so far, and anyways music is an entirely subjective experience, so your mileage will vary on my interpretations of the finer points of instrumentation.
			</p>
			<p>
			<i>In the event</i> that you’re Ms. Steinberg and you’re grading this final project: please enjoy! I had a blast reflecting upon all the things I’ve learned during my tenure here. I built this website myself for two reasons. For one, I really enjoy self-inflicted punishment, and for some reason staying up into the early hours of the morning debugging code is genuinely appealing to me. But since it’s all hand-built, I’ve infused every section with my own in-jokes and personal touches, stories that I couldn’t feasibly fit in the structure of this piece. It’s basically my musical code love child. I hope you have as good of a time reading this as I had writing it.
			</p>
			<p>
			<i>Finally, in the event</i> that you’re none of these people (or someone to whom I emailed this in a spurt of enthusiastic joy): welcome to 6 pages of food adjectives used to describe instrumental tonalities! There’s a certain joy I take in incongruity, of which you’ll see copious amounts of—coacervates<a class="source" alt="these are little organic droplets that have their own lipid membranes and may have been life’s earliest precursors">[3]</a> as moral lessons for chord building, flavors of La Croix<a class="source" alt="or just La Croix in general tbh">[4]</a> used to belittle middle school violinists. My world of music seeps into the fabric of life, stains with melody everything I perceive. This manual is part comedy and part practical knowledge, but mostly it’s a love letter to my two-and-a-half years in this music program. It’s a testament to the people I’ve been inspired by, a thesis on the things I’ve learned, and an attempt to—in some way—celebrate the immense amounts of help I’ve needed from the people around me to get to the places I’ve been and climb to the places I’ll go.

			<p>
			<b>Hello. You’re all back.</b> Let’s continue, then!
			</p>
			<p>
			My musical process emphasizes instrumentation, orchestration, and the overall enjoyment of the ensemble who plays it. Computer scientists would call that top-down processing—where you’re preeminently concerned with how the shipped product feels to the end user.<a class="source" alt="I’m also scarred by years of Richard Meyer viola parts.">[5]</a> Dealing with the individual personalities of the instruments is by far the most interesting part for me, since it’s like painting a picture with timbres, so it’s gonna be a fat section of this manual. Making sure the parts are actually playable for each musician comes later in my personal process, but it’s got a lot to do with the actual instruments, so that section will be stuck with the instrument profiles also.
			</p>
			<p>
			I’ll cover writing and the more creative compositional aspects of arranging in the middle section, including ensembles that you’re willing to write for and the strengths of each. All this gets into actual theory, which I don’t have any formal education in, so I really don’t anticipate it being comprehensive by any means. I have a couple hot takes on how to write for strings,<a class="source" alt="especially for violists">[6]</a> but you’ll see a conspicuous lack of the same courtesy extended to the band kids.
			</p>
			<p>
			Typesetting is the part that keeps me up till the early hours of dawn, so in an effort to help you through that pain, I’ve included a guide on how to make your music look professional (or, at least, not like your default open-source music notation program). There’s some important things regarding how to notate certain things and how much freedom you get to really make your scores your own. 
			</p>
			<p>
			To close, there’s some last words on how to get your piece played here at CHS and some recommendations regarding the best talent to tap.  The music program here provides the fuel to all our compositional and arrangement adventures, and I can’t wait to share it with you. Thanks, Mr. Handley and Soap Butt, couldn’t have gotten anywhere without you guys.
