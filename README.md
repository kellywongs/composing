## i. Introduction

### a. Preface

**First of all,** I'd like to extend my dearest condolences to anyone who happens upon this manual. It may be too abstract and lighthearted for the seeker of practical knowledge; it may be too much of me talking out of my ass about instruments I don't understand for the serious apprentice of any wind or brass instrument; for the musically uninitiated, it may simply be too self-congratulatory.[^hindemith] Which leaves us with a net value of zero, and I didn't spend ten hours writing code for this page to be ultimately purposeless, so let's try to avoid that.

To avoid losing anyone, I'll do my best to tread the line between enthusiastically expounding on a topic and drowning in poeticisms. This should ultimately be accessible to all audiences, regardless of previous musical knowledge or any predisposition towards a certain instrument grouping.[^strings]

There are two general audiences whose presence I anticipate, and still more who I will not, so my prefaces will be allocated thusly:

***In the event*** that you're my hypothetical target audience, a student musician who's recently caught The Arranging Bug: you're in the right place! This manual is meant to explicate my perception of the intricacies of orchestration and my personal process of turning others' art into your own. I've written down tricks I've picked up about typesetting music, coming up with tempo markings, and recruiting musicians to play your piece. There's a whole psychological profile and political alignment chart for every instrument in the symphony, to peruse for your pleasure. As a disclaimer, my only authority rests on the couple of pieces[^six] I've written for CHS ensembles so far, and anyways music is an entirely subjective experience, so your mileage will vary on my interpretations of the finer points of instrumentation.

***In the event*** that you're Ms. Steinberg and you're grading this final project: please enjoy! I had a blast reflecting on all the things I've learned during my tenure here. I built this website myself because I really enjoy self-inflicted punishment, and for some reason staying up into the early hours of the morning debugging code is genuinely appealing to me.[^markdown] But it's also the ~~quickest~~ most interesting way to create a space that was wholly mine, down to the atom; from the visual design to the snappy footnotes to the code that makes the site tick, I've stretched every one of my technical skills in order to better express the art married to it. It seemed fitting that a work this personal should have my hand at every level of creation. I hope you have as good of a time reading this as I had writing it.

Finally, ***in the event*** that you're none of these people (or someone to whom I emailed this to prove that I did, in fact, have a reason for interrogating you on your political ideologies): welcome to 9 pages of food adjectives used to describe instrumental tonalities! There's a certain joy I take in incongruity, of which you'll see copious amounts of—coacervates[^coacervates] as moral lessons for chord building, flavors of La Croix[^lacroix] used to belittle middle school violinists. My world of music seeps into the fabric of life, stains with melody everything I perceive. This manual is part comedy hour and part practical knowledge, but mostly it's a love letter to my two-and-a-half years in this music program. It's a testament to the people I've been inspired by, a thesis on the things I've learned, and an attempt to—in some way—celebrate the immense amounts of help I've needed from the people around me to get to the places I've been and climb to the places I'll go.

Plentiful thank-yous are in order to Handley, Sophia, and Adam; I couldn't have written any of this without you guys.

[^hindemith]: Hindemith had a whole thing about who wouldn't like his book. It took like three pages and was overall just So Many more words than I really wanted to read about his specific target audience.

[^strings]: I'm going to use this space right now to admit that I primarily play viola and I'm grossly biased towards my section. When I write, I specifically account for the enjoyment of the viola section and I give a lot of credit to the tone that violas can produce, occasionally to the detriment of the violin II section. Writing for the Band Show and spending time with wind/brass players has allowed me to grasp the beauty and appeal of their world, but it remains that my attentions are focused--whether consciously or not--on the strings.

[^six]: Six!

[^markdown]: I originally wrote this entire framework in HTML, the skeleton of which you can still see in the [notanindex.html](https://github.com/kellywongs/composing/blob/master/notanindex.html) file that (for historical purposes, and foolishness) I'm not deleting from this Git repository. I ran into issue after issue with Javascript implementation and the projected difficulty of maintaining the site which, for the record, I forsaw when I started writing the code but ignored anyways. I complained about this all to my dad, a software developer who's been in love with Markdown for the last nine years. He suggested I migrate the entire site to Markdown. I muffled a scream because I knew he was right. Now I'm typing this from my Atom editor that I've altered to display code in sans-serif, things are easy to edit, Github-flavored Markdown is doing me a solid with built-in support for these footnote things, and life is great.

[^coacervates]: [Coacervates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coacervate) are little organic droplets that have their own lipid membranes and may have been life's earliest precursors. We did a lab with them in AP Biology, which was pretty much the highlight of my year (alternatively because I like playing God and/or molecular biology and cell evolution, take your pick). It's exhilarating to add acid to gelatin/gum arabic and watch it wriggle to proto-life. Distressingly, second period had a group (Grace Donnelly, Jacob Matiyevsky, and Aristotle Henderson) whose coacervates seemed to go beyond proto-life--they began to merge and consume each other, growing and changing, unsettling everybody who heard about it.

[^lacroix]: '[Pamplemousse](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pyekL%2BcnL.jpg)' flavored??????????????????? What does that taste like, if not a fluffy pink bathroom robe???

### b. Contents Held Forthwith

**Hello. You're all back.** Let's continue, then!

To me, the most intriguing compositional processes involve instrumentation, orchestration, and the overall enjoyment of the ensemble who plays it.[^computer] To this end, I'm starting this manual with a lengthy **[field guide to the orchestra](#ii-field-guide)**, which deals in mildly incongruous adjectives to deliver my sense of the personality tropes that define, guide, and strengthen each instrumental section. Of course, this also gets into questions of range, capability, and the overall playability of the part, so we'll discuss technical requirements and abilities at length.

I'll cover **[writing](#iii-writing)** and the more technical aspects of arranging for various ensembles in the middle section. Here we'll start getting into actual theory, which I don't have any formal education in, so I really don't anticipate it being comprehensive by any means. Since I've been raised in the string orchestra world, I have many a hot take on how to write for strings (*especially* how to write engaging viola parts; this is a direct attack on JW Pepper). Regarding brass and wind, I've written a couple parts and I've pestered a couple sources, but I'll readily accept that I haven't given them the same amount of precision as I have our string brethren. I have, as they say, clowned them. Sorry about that.

**[Typesetting](#iv-typesetting)** is the part that keeps me up till the early hours of dawn, so in an effort to help you through that pain, I've included a guide on how to make your music look professional (or, at least, not like your default open-source music notation program). There's some important things regarding how to notate certain things and how much freedom you get to really make your scores your own.

A lot of these lessons I've learned have come from **[pieces](#v-pieces)** I've had the privilege to write and perform here at Carmel: one for VAPA, five for the Band Show, all for a certain inexorable teacher whose presence impacts me still. I've written a little bit about each piece and what I took away from each, including burnout and how to find juice for your next incredible project.

To close, there's some **[closing words](#vi-closing-words)** on the best resources to tap here in Carmel, and general well-wishes regarding the current State Of The Music Program and the undertaking that is the Concert for Whitney. The music program here provides the fuel to all our compositional and arrangement adventures, and I can't wait to share it with you.

[^computer]: Computer scientists would call this top-down processing—where you're preeminently concerned with how the shipped product feels to the end user.

### a. Field Guide Introduction

**I find that everyone has an instrumental ‘vibe' to them**—some aspects of their being that match, occasionally to humorous effect, the personality and timbre of a certain instrument. For example, trumpet culture is dramatically different from violin I culture, for reasons too subjective to explain fully. Obviously, the personality stereotypes associated with each section are neither definitive nor concrete, as musicians hail from all walks of life and all temperaments. However, I maintain that there are salient characteristics in each instrument to which a certain brand of person is attracted, and anyways it's really fun to try and stereotype the phenomenon that is Orchestra Culture, so here we are.

There is, in fact, a purpose for such partitioning, humor and rehearsal boredom notwithstanding. For me, clever orchestration involves understanding the unique speaking styles of each instrument, physically *and* mentally; passages can be within the physical range of many instruments, but squarely in the emotional range of one.[^auxiliary] At the end of each section, I'll have a couple pointers on practical considerations regarding ranges and articulation limits and such, with a  special focus on the abilities of ensembles here at Carmel High. It's gonna be a fat section here, so hold on tight. We'll start our tour in the ensemble that I'm the most intimately familiar with, and save the kazoos for the end.

[^auxiliary]: This guide also has the auxiliary purpose of attempting to help you spot instrument players in the wild, should the need ever arise to defend yourself from one.

### b. Explanations

**Before we really get started,** though, I should probably explain some of the dichotomies I've used to loosely define every section on my massive moral alignment chart. I've created[^created] a seven-dimensional chart to roughly categorize instruments by instrumental strength, orchestral role, and quality of timbre.

| moral alignment chart | [lawful/<br>chaotic](#lawful-vs-chaotic) | [cronchy/<br>wet](#cronchy-vs-wet) | [coarse/<br>majestic](#coarse-vs-majestic) | [capitalist/<br>communist](#capitalist-vs-communist) | [authoritarian/<br>liberal](#authoritarian-vs-liberal) | [strong/<br>weak](#strong-vs-weak) | [good/<br>evil](#good-vs-evil) |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| violin i | lawful | wet | majestic | capitalist | authoritarian | strong | good |
| viola | chaotic | cronchy | majestic | communsit | liberal | weak | good |
| flute | lawful | wet | majestic | capitalist | authoritarian | weak | good |
| trumpet | chaotic | cronchy | majestic | communist | authoritarian | strong | good |
| fire extinguisher | chaotic | cronchy | coarse | communist | liberal | strong | evil |

*Figure ii.b.1: An example morality chart for select instruments across the orchestra.*

[^created]: This whole personality measurement started out as a joke to measure people, which revealed some pretty interesting stratifications across political and personality lines. I am, for example, *chaotic cronchy majestic communist strong liberal good*; I share this personality type with Harrison Bolton and Deckelmann. Handley is *lawful wet majestic communist strong authoritarian good*. Grummon was *chaotic cronchy majestic communist strong*est* liberal good*. Teachers tend to be more lawful and authoritarian than students, of whom a majority are chaotic communist liberals.

#### Lawful vs. Chaotic:
##### Stop! You're under a rest!

> *Lawful instruments:* violin i/ii, cello, flute, oboe, english horn, bassoon, contrabassoon, french horn, timpani, triangle, mallet instruments, piano, bass, voice

> *Chaotic instruments:* violin iii, viola, contrabass, piccolo, clarinet, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, tuba, euphonium, drums, bongos, fire extinguisher, guitar, recorder, kazoo, melodica

**Lawful** describes the overall ability of the instrument to create an orthodox, orderly tone. Instruments that fall on this side of the continuum have a reputation of making sense, being pleasing to the ear, and having a calmness to their timbre. They frequently have leadership positions within the orchestra and often suffer from some degree of orchestral politics. [Flutists](#flutes) and [first violinists](#violins) are, by nature, more lawful than [trombonists](#trombones) and [violists](#violas).

**Chaotic** instruments are freer to experiment, produce a wilder sound, and are encouraged—by temperament or by section—to rebel in what ways they can. Their tonal qualities are more unusual than that of the lawful instruments. They fall into two extremes: those whose sound is inherently piercing (as in the case with the [piccolos](#piccolos) and [oboes](#oboes)), and those whose stereotype of demureness encourages memery within the section ([contrabass](#basses) and [clarinets](#clarinets)). Historically, they may have been sidelined in the orchestra in favor of their more palatable counterparts.

#### Cronchy vs. Wet:
##### Moistness of temperament

> *Cronchy instruments:* violin ii/iii, viola, contrabass, piccolo, oboe, contrabassoon, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, tuba, euphonium, percussion, drums, triangle, bongos, fire extinguisher, tambourine, bass, kazoos

> *Wet instruments:* violin i, cello, flute, clarinet, english horn, bassoon, french horn, timpani, piano, guitar, voice, recorder, melodica, xylophone, marimba

Here we’re getting into specific tonalities. An instrument rated *cronchy* produces a sterner, sharper sound than one rated *wet*. **Cronchiness** correlates with, but does not cause, the general disagreeableness of an instrument’s sound; **wetness** can easily lead to a flabby, weak tone if not harnessed properly by its player. Young musicians are prone to being victims of an instrument's inherent cronchiness or wetness.

When used correctly, both voices are crucial in an orchestra for blend and pizazz in their own right—*cronchy* instruments have a more distinct voice than wet instruments, but *wet* instruments are aural emollients. Contrast a [saxophone](#saxophones) with a [flute](#flutes), or a contrabass with a [violin](#violins).

#### Coarse vs. Majestic:
##### Shaken or stirred?

> *Coarse instruments:* violin ii/iii, contrabass, piccolo, trombone, percussion, drums, bongos, fire extinguisher, guitar, recorder, kazoo, melodica, xylophone

> *Majestic instruments:* violin i, viola, cello, flute, clarinet, oboe, english horn, bassoon, contrabassoon, saxophone, trumpet, french horn, timpani, triangle, tambourine, piano, bass, voice, marimba, glockenspiel

Along similar lines, a **majestic** instrument is thought of as being noble and soaring, billowy and brassy. **Coarse** instruments are rougher-voiced and more boisterous, dirty and jazzy and grounded. Take note that *cronchy* instruments (sterner and harder) are not necessarily *coarse* (exciting and filthy), and *wet* (smooth and edible) instruments will not always be *majestic* (clean and pompous). The [trumpets](#violas) are a notable example of an instrument that is both *cronchy* and *majestic.* There are fewer instruments that are *wet* and *coarse,* capable of slick dirtiness and easily-digestible jazz, but they exist—[clarinet](#clarinets) and [guitar](#guitars) come to mind.

#### Capitalist vs. Communist:
##### How many solos you want

> *Capitalist instruments:* violin i/ii, cello, flute, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, english horn, french horn, piano, voice, melodica

> *Communist instruments:* violin iii, viola, contrabass, bassoon, contrabassoon, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, tuba, euphonium, guitar, bass, recorder, kazoo

This is more of a culture-specific descriptor than anything to do with tonality. **Capitalist** sections are more political and hierarchical than **communist** sections, which tend to be much more laid-back in terms of seat placement and part assignment. The string and wind sections are more susceptible to capitalism than the brass sections; [violas](#violas) and [bassoons](#bassoons) are notable exceptions.

In general, *capitalism* and *communism* correlate strongly with *lawfulness/chaoticness* and *authoritarianism/liberalism* (which we’ll discuss shortly). I've omitted most percussion instruments from this listing because they don't really have seat politics.[^seats]

[^seats]: Because they stand.

#### Authoritarian vs. Liberal:
##### How many solos you get

> *Authoritarian instruments:* violin i/ii, cello, flute, piccolo, oboe, contrabassoon, trumpet, trombone, tuba, drums, timpani, triangle, piano, voice, recorder, kazoo, melodica

> *Liberal instruments:* violin iii, viola, contrabass, clarinet, english horn, bassoon, saxophone, french horn, euphonium, percussion, bongos, fire extinguisher, tambourine, guitar, bass, mallet instruments

Describing something very similar to *capitalism/communism,* *authoritarianism/liberalism* rates the roles that a section tends to take in a piece (instead of the roles they take in an orchestra, as with capitalism/communism). **Authoritarian** instruments frequently dominate the tonal conversation through their range, timbre, and volume. They take prominent melodic lines in orchestration and rarely play second fiddle (haha) to their more *liberal* counterparts. Every section has a particularly *authoritarian* player to whom the other parts look for guidance: [violins](#violins) in the strings, [oboe](#oboes) and [flute](#flutes) in the winds, [trumpets](#trumpets) in the brass.

**Liberal** instruments are the opposite. They generally play the supporting roles in instrumental compositions, owing to their mellow timbres and less extreme ranges. Solos are rarely divvied out to these guys, having been relegated largely to harmonies and atmosphere.[^fifthyesterday] This can be a point of resentment for many a [viola](#violas) or [horn](#french-horns) player; however, the reality is that the orchestra cannot function without these players to glue the rest of the authoritarians together.

[^fifthyesterday]: I went to a performance of [Beethoven's 5th Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olMPeiqoiic) yesterday. (Which yesterday? Idk, look at the commit history.) It reminded me of Beethoven's habit of letting the violas introduce a new melodic theme by themselves, and then subsequently making them play a tremelo or some ridiculous triplet run while the rest of the orchestra had fun playing the themes themselves.

#### Strong vs. Weak:
##### A measure of physical strength

> *Strong instruments:* violin i, cello, contrabass, piccolo, oboe, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, tuba, euphonium, percussion, drums, timpani, triangle, bongos, fire extinguisher, guitar, kazoo, xylophone, glockenspiel

> *Weak instruments:* violin ii/iii, viola, flute, clarinet, english horn, bassoon, contrabassoon, french horn, tambourine, bass, voice, recorder, melodica, marimba

 Though *authoritarianism/liberalism* deals with how prominent each instrument's melodic lines are, *strong/weak* describes how easy it is to shout over these lines. In other words, it deals with sheer volume and acoustic efficiency. **Strong** instruments have an ability to project across a concert hall because of their physical design ([cellos](#cellos) and [trombones](#trombones)). It follows that **weak** instruments do not ([clarinets](#clarinets) and [french horns](#french-horns)).

As with some of the other classifications, the *authoritarianism* of an instrument does not necessarily lead to its *strength*. The [flute](#flutes) is an example of such an instrument: it has a piercing and *authoritarian* timbre, but its *wet majesty* ultimately leads to its overall *weakness* in the face of a whole symphony.

#### Good vs. Evil:
##### Are you a piccolo or not

> *Good instruments:* violin i/ii/iii, viola, cello, flute, clarinet, oboe, english horn, bassoon, saxophone, trumpet, french horn, tuba, euphonium, timpani, piano, voice, melodica, mallet Instruments

> *Evil instruments:* contrabass, piccolo, contrabassoon, trombone, sousaphone, percussion, drums, fire extinguisher, triangle, bongos, tambourine, guitar, bass, recorder, kazoo

Our final personality trope is *good vs. evil.* It's a remnant of the original human morality chart that stratified people across temperamental lines. As nebulous as evil is to define among humans, it's doubly difficult to apply it to instruments, through whom we speak.

So what *does* it mean?

**Evil** instruments are those who find it easy to disrupt the peace of a piece, so to speak. A combination of their *cronchiness, authoritarianism,* and *strength*--cacophony, timbre, and volume--allows whatever they do to soar over the rest of the orchestra and easily derail any endeavor. It doesn't matter how loudly people are noodling in a practice hall: the smallest sound from an evil instrument bounces around in your brain for hours. Notable offenders are [basses](#contrabasses) and [piccolos](#piccolos).

**Good** instruments tend to contribute to the euphony of the larger group. Though leadership disposition (via *lawfulness*) influences this considerably, the larger variables are their *wetness, majesty,* and *liberalism*. Any one of these qualities makes it difficult to be evil, simply because they cannot be loud or disruptive enough. The quintessential *good* instrument is the [bassoon](#bassoons), for its sextuple-whammy lawful-wet-majestic-communist-liberal-weak personality type.

### c. Strings

| strings |   *an overview*          |
| ---  |  |
| members | [violins](#violins) (i, ii, we don’t talk about iii); [violas](#violas); [cellos](#cellos); [contrabasses](#basses)
| strengths | adaptability, emotion, romance, evenness, drama, filler, playing for long periods of time without tiring, being able to eat while playing, adapting to intonation changes as a big group |
| weaknesses | playing without vibrato, purity of tone, faking things, intonation in small settings, irregularly-shaped runs |
| dynamics | *pppp* to *fff* |

*Figure ii.c.1: An overview of the string section.*

**I don’t want to sound biased,** but the string section as a whole is unrivaled in terms of emotional flexibility, range of coloration, and pyrotechnic capability.[^flex] From the pared-down harmonies of a string quartet to the expansive lushness of a string orchestra, string players are capable of producing almost any imaginable sound. Of course, they need their brass and wind colleagues to add the spark and extremes of emotions that the strings just can’t produce on their own, but for the most part their capability for diversity and dynamism makes them a compelling choice for pretty much any ensemble. It's why they're ubiquitous in the concert music world, and why you can never seem to get away from those with colorful BAM cases strapped to their backs.

| moral alignment chart | [lawful/<br>chaotic](#lawful-vs-chaotic) | [cronchy/<br>wet](#cronchy-vs-wet) | [coarse/<br>majestic](#coarse-vs-majestic) | [capitalist/<br>communist](#capitalist-vs-communist) | [authoritarian/<br>liberal](#authoritarian-vs-liberal) | [strong/<br>weak](#strong-vs-weak) | [good/<br>evil](#good-vs-evil) |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| violin i | lawful | wet | majestic | capitalist | authoritarian | strong | good |
| violin ii | lawful | cronchy | coarse | capitalist | authoritarian | weak | good |
| violin iii | chaotic | cronchy | coarse | communist | liberal | weak | good |
| viola | chaotic | cronchy | majestic | communist | liberal | weak | good |
| cello | lawful | wet | majestic | capitalist | authoritarian | strong | good |
| contrabass | chaotic | cronchy | coarse | communist | liberal | strong | evil |

*Figure ii.c.2: String section moral alignment chart. Note the near-identical political alignments of the Violin I and Cello sections; contrast this with the dramatic differences between, but fundamental shared weaknesses of, Violin II and Viola.*

You’ll notice that the above political alignment chart can’t seem to fit the string section across any dichotomy. Overall, they’re neither lawful nor chaotic, majestic nor coarse; they can’t even decide if they’re good or evil. In music, similarly, the strings play every imaginable role and sing every imaginable part. They’re particularly good at swells of power, saccharine-sweet passages, and mediating the field of timbres between the other members of the symphony. Their primary weaknesses, especially at a younger age, are an inability to play without vibrato (to produce a pure tone of a quality akin to that of the horns--it's technically possible, but no one wants to acknowledge it) and a general abundance of schmultz.

We'll get into the specifics of writing for extended [string technique](#string-technique), but first, let's talk about why we're so insufferable and why you can't live without us.

[^flex]: The latter flex can also be taken quite literally if necessary.

#### Violins

| violins | *an overview* |
| ---  |  |
| high range | brilliant, volatile, crystalline |
| middle range | schmultzy, sweet, focused |
| low range | dramatic, wild, startling |
| major weakness | not playing each other's solos |
| range | G3--A7 |
| dynamics | *pppp* to *ff* |
| clefs | treble, in C |
| tuning | G3 D4 A4 E5 |
| listen to this! |  *violin solo:* [Vitali: Chaconne in G Minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4B1ifcWa9o)[^chaconne] <Br> *concerto:* [Bruch: Violin Concerto No. 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDJ6Wbzgy3E&)[^bruchconcerto]

*Figure ii.c.3: An overview of the violin section. Their maximum volume is* ff, *not the* fff *that the larger orchestra is capable of.*

[^chaconne]: [Vitali: Chaconne in G Minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4B1ifcWa9o), played by Oistrakh. This is the piece I think of whenever I talk about the violin's inexorable schmultzyness--sometimes this will come up on my music and I'll swipe it away because I'm really just not in the mood to deal with it. It's undeniably beautiful, though. It's also a great contrast to the second link that I have, which is a concerto played by Hilary Hahn: Oistrach's wild vibrato and portamento is so different from Hahn's crystal-clear purity.

[^bruchconcerto]: [Bruch: Violin Concerto No. 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDJ6Wbzgy3E&), played by Hilary Hahn. I don't actually listen to that many violin concertos, but this is one of my favorites because of the pyrotechnics of the violin and [this](https://youtu.be/KDJ6Wbzgy3E?t=408) kickass orchestral beat drop.

*Figure ii.c.4: A moral alignment chart for all the violin sections. All three are ultimately good, but Violin I and III are fundamentally different in every other way.*

**You may be a violinist** if you’re slightly fragile, moderately self-deprecating, and have extreme reactions to caffeine. There are generally two divisions of violinists in any orchestra, the violins I and II; occasionally (with Bach and distrustful grade-school arrangers in equal measure) you get a violin III section. No one likes talking about the violin IIIs, but it’s a section nevertheless, so as it stands we’ve got ourselves three very diverse personality types on one instrument.

> Violin I: lawful wet majestic capitalist authoritarian strong good

***First violinists:*** First violinists often fall into two physical archetypes, both of which seem so well-suited to the instrument that it may as well be destiny.

*Archetype the first:* spindly and long, enamored with dank memes, an Android user; they’re relaxed until they’re not, after which they’re stormy and melodramatic like a Beethoven middle movement incarnate ([Beethoven: Symphony No. 6, 'Pastorale,'](https://youtu.be/fRg0K5rgXog?t=1872) IV: Allegro -- Sturm).[^beethoven6] Whether they’re comfortable discussing their chair placement varies wildly on a day-to-day basis, but as with most first violinists, it’s best to leave this question a wide berth. These are more common in the chamber music arena than the second type, which can more easily be found in the symphony orchestra,

*The second type* of first violinist is small enough to bunch up their legs when they play. They’re easily angered and are invariably in a higher math class than you. (This kind has an iPhone and an infrequently-updated Snapchat account.) They’re into memes, too, but they’re of the purer variety—they are, after all, cat people. This type is the kind to drink three espresso shots as part of their morning routine, and then show up at rehearsal buzzing with frenetic energy.

How many AP classes these kids take typically has an inverse relationship with how much they care about being concertmaster, but take care to exercise caution regardless; nowhere are the first-chair politics more cutthroat than in the first violin section.

> Violin II: lawful cronchy coarse capitalist authoritarian weak good

***Second violinists:*** We come across more diversity and relaxation as we move left, entering the realm of the second violinists. The second violinists I've known in the orchestra are quiet, studious, but fountains of wit if you ask them any questions. A majority of elementary horse girls end up here, for one reason or another. It's the perennial curse of youth orchestras that the more inexperienced players are relegated to this section, so often they'll have less confidence and bombast than their first violin counterparts. On the flip side, they're easily the section that's genuinely trying the hardest.

These descriptions apply to career second violinists. In smaller ensembles (like pit orchestras and string quartets), the Violin II section tend to be drawn from the pool of available Violin I players because of their experience with the world of solos and exposed parts. In these cases, they are not truly second violinists so much as they are mildly displaced first violinists. The same is true with violinists playing viola, though I'd argue that in both cases there is an observable mellowing of [capitalism](#capitalist-vs-communism).

> Violin III: chaotic cronchy coarse communist liberal weak good

***Third violinists:*** Because of their proximity and association with the [viola](#viola) section, the third violin section will be more mellow and [chaotic](#lawful-vs-chaotic) than their peers in the first two sections. That they are now forever stuck on accompaniment is not lost on them, which breeds a small amount of resentment in transplants from Violin I. The overall sentiment of the section leans grudgingly towards [communism](#capitalist-vs-communism), especially among those who are put in Violin III out of necessity rather than orchestration.

It is important to note that you will never meet *career* third violinists, but they are ubiquitious in two settings and thus deserve a mention here. The first is in the middle school string orchestra, where a Violin III part is occasionally added to balance the (generally ill-populated) viola section, or otherwise to give some less experienced violinists a break. The second is in music written for large string orchestras, including the [Bach Brandenburg Concertos](#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdsyNwUoON0).[^three] Though third violin sections are typically temporary phenomena, distance from the other violin sections nevertheless speciates them.

[^three]: [Bach: Brandenburg Concerto #3](#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdsyNwUoON0). If there are three or more violin parts, you can be sure that there are a couple more viola and cello parts, too. However, since it's generally much rarer to split viola and cello further, the sections never develop a distinct personality and so are omitted from this field guide.)

[^beethoven6]: [Beethoven: Symphony No. 6, 'Pastorale,'](https://youtu.be/fRg0K5rgXog?t=1872) IV: Allegro -- Sturm. This is the only movement with a timpani part. When we played this with the Monterey Symphony, the timpanist was taking a nap backstage during the (admittedly quite long) first three movements and forgot to come back for this one. I didn't notice because I was too busy trying to hang with the intense tremelo that Beethoven asks of you, but apparently it was quite catastrophic. (Also, fun fact--this was the first piece of serious music I ever played. It was quite an exercise in exposure therapy, I'll say that much.)

##### ii. general notes

**Violins, like [cellos](#cellos), are fortunate** in that their instrument's acoustic design is ideal for the range of pitches that it can produce.[^notviolas] Consequently, it's easy to squeeze soaring passages and dramatic vibratos out of these guys. In the right ranges, like those that the first violins frequently splash in, authoritarian violins can command the symphony. If you have a large and sweeping passage that you need to get heard, the violins have a flexibility and vitality that's quite unmatched by the rest of the orchestra.

 In comparison with their high and extremely high ranges, the violin's middle and low ranges can be quite mellow in comparison. (For example, the area around the violin D string can be much less powerful than a viola D string--this is mostly attributed to acoustics and the placement of the D string on the respective instruments.) Experienced violinists will make up for this by playing with a vibrato that will make the tone project more. However, younger string orchestras sometimes have difficulty compensating for this, so the lowest octaves may sound watery and weak. Contrast this with the [cellos](#cellos), whose equivalent octaves (high for cellos, low for violins) are naturally powerful and soaring, with a throaty chest-voice quality.

 But there's an interesting technique that you can play with here, especially when writing for solo violin parts ([Monti: Czardas](https://youtu.be/ZHO6KOPWXtc?t=24)).[^czardas] Specifying higher-octave passages to be on the G string will force players to *portamento,* or glissando, on some interval leaps; vibrato will be dramatically amplified because of the smaller spaces between notes. The result is a wild, taut, gypsy-like sound. Don't overdo it, obviously; it's too theatrical for common usage. But it's breathtaking when executed correctly ([Suppe: Light Cavalry Overture](https://youtu.be/k_XLnFGNhL0?t=245)).[^lightcavalry]

 Whatever you do, take care of the second violins. At Carmel High and many equivalent high school string orchestras, the average player in the second violin section will  be less experienced than the average player in the first violin section. Though it makes for a charming section, the sound they produce can be weak (i.e. in my senior year at Carmel, we had a couple rehearsals where Handley had to tell our four-person viola section to stop covering the fourteen-person violin II section).

 This is not to say that you should simplify violin II rhythms or harmonic parts. In fact, when writing for orchestras that are like this, consider giving the violin II section more melodic content--if they're confident about what they're playing, and they're not stuck in unfamiliar intervals of harmony with the first violins, they'll project beautifully and produce the trademark Thick Violin Sound.

 (The Thick Violin Sound is a shimmering combination of many  players playing the same passage with mildly different intonations and vibrato speeds. This slight incongruity, when combined with the general unity and homogeneity of the violin sound across all octaves, is what really warms and ties the whole orchestra together. It's absolutely spectacular when everyone's playing in unison or in octaves.)

 Avoid giving out too many differing syncopated rhythms or shying away from predictable patterns. This applies equally to all intermediate string parts, but especially to the second violins, who can be collectively slow to mature because of their relatively younger players. Also, it's just irritating sometimes.

 [^czardas]: [Monti: Czardas](https://youtu.be/ZHO6KOPWXtc?t=24). For a famous example of the usage of *sul g,* as it's called, listen to the beginning of this piece. It's based on a Hungarian dance--a *csárdás*--that begins slow and finishes wildly.

 [^lightcavalry]: [Suppe: Light Cavalry Overture](https://youtu.be/k_XLnFGNhL0?t=245). Here's a piece that uses *sul G* or *sul C* across the orchestra--it can be done! The effect of a whole orchestra sliding up to their notes, playing in unison, is pretty sick. It's rhapsodic and melancholy and also really fun to play. Also you should stay for the kickass trumpet soli right after the passage.

[^clarke]: [Clarke: Sonata for Viola and Piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyhWWyDHIfM). I've played this for about a year now, and I'm sorry to see my passion for it fade over time, but this really is an incredible piece. It starts at about a 110% and just goes up from there. This is what I pull up whenever I'm showing someone that the higher registers on a viola are more yearning and powerful than that of a violin: there's something about it speaks rather than sings. (Hence the [cronchiness](#cronchy-vs-wet).) Clarke enjoys playing with the more extreme harmonic capabilities of the viola, especially in this sonata's alien [second movement](https://youtu.be/kyhWWyDHIfM?t=441).

[^hindemithconcerto]: [Hindemith: Viola Concerto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkFbrUEhSCc). Devilishly difficult, but just extraordinary in all senses of the word. Some really wack double stops and chords (and fingerings, and pyrotechnics, and techniques, and...). Hindemith understood how to make the viola sing--he starts off this piece with this giant quadruple stop that ends with an E-E octave. Also, the [second movement](https://youtu.be/NkFbrUEhSCc?t=536) begins with a modest and sweet viola/harp duet, and it just really stops you in your tracks.

**If you have a very fluid and ambiguous sexuality,** really like Drake, and have somewhat of an inferiority complex, you may just be a violist.

Violists are closest to [high brass](#e-brass) players because of a potent combination of chaotic capability and orchestral responsibility. ([Bassists](#basses) are the string equivalent of the low brass; that the violas and [trumpets](#trumpets) are asked more often to play prominent melodic parts keeps them in check.) Of the continental string orchestra, they're the chillest and least capitalist section. They make up for their lack of the orchestral spotlight by being really up in arms about the worth of a viola as an instrument. Any solos they get are a point of pride that they blow out of proportion to others and then forget to practice. But theyve been accompanying the violins their whole lives, so they've kind of accepted their fate, and this is the section that most genuinely throws themselves into the boring fifths and thirds that make the rest of the orchestra sound so good.

As with the second violins, it's important to distinguish between career violists and those who double on viola, but whose primary instrument is the violin. Viola will mellow out the capitalistic tendencies of violinists, but violinists rarely become chaotic or cronchy because of their viola experience.

Along similar lines, there are those who primarily play viola but play violin when it's called for.[^pitviola] Violists on violin have a very intense vibrato, because of the amount of vibrato necessary to speak on viola; their playing may become wetter on viola because of the influence of the smoother violin sound. There's an increase in capitalism proportional to which violin section they represent when they play violin.

[^pitviola]: Or when pit orchestra has no viola parts, like *both* of the musicals we did in my senior year (Addams Family and Guys and Dolls).

##### ii. general notes

**In the first movement of [Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg0M4LzEITQ),** there's a viola soli that's played all the way up in your nostrils. It's ghostly and pale, simultaneously recognizable (because it has the tonal uniformity of the rest of the string orchestra) and alien (because there's some timbre you can't put your finger on). There's something unsettling about not being able to place who's playing, something fundamentally unfamiliar about the choked-up timbres of the viola that you just can't place.

To me, this exemplifies the purpose of the viola and the extraordinary effects that it can produce. The viola section has a very distinct tone that's very different from that of the violin sections. Because it's acoustically strangled and there are fewer places where the resonance *really* works, a viola's tone is what you would get if you took a violin's sound and aged it in a barrel for a little while.

All registers but the very high are rather muffled for violas. For this reason, it's not a great idea to try and use violas to carry a melodic line at times where significant amounts of people are playing. Even where the orchestration is thinner, the lines played by violas are unlikely to be very loud or vivacious. Maybe that's what you're going for, though: melancholy, thick, and sort of flat.

Keep in mind that violas, because of their larger design and thicker strings, take more energy and time to speak than the lithe violins. This trend continues down the whole string orchestra down to the basses, who you *really* need to take care of in terms of speed and agility. The violas still enjoy complex passages, of course, but in this way they are not equivalent to violins.

| techniques | bowing, vibrato, harmonics, pizzicato, martele, marcato, col legno, glissando/portamento, sul tasto/sul ponticello, double stops |

The melodies that bounce around in my head are translated into the diverse language of a string orchestra first and foremost—bubbly pizzicatos, ghostly *col legnos*, the intense visual spectacle of an orchestra lifting their bows at the same time. I'm taking the liberty of addressing all of these at once, because a string orchestra is pretty homogenous in terms of tone production and available techniques.

##### general notes:

Chromaticism comes easily to violins, more so than violas and cellos (who have a larger area in which to make intonation errors). However, it's still inadvisable to give the strings rapid chromatic passages, which will sound muddy and

#####

[^notviolas]: [Violas](#violas) and [basses](#basses) do not share this quality. They're built a couple inches smaller than their ideal lengths because the fully optimized size would be impractical--cue the [octobasse](#basses). As a result, they can sound strangled, like their bodies can't handle the frequencies that the player is trying to wrangle; they do not have the same easy  timbre that violins and cellos enjoy.)
