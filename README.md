## i. Introduction

### a. Preface

**First of all,** I'd like to extend my dearest condolences to anyone who happens upon this manual. It may be too abstract and lighthearted for the seeker of practical knowledge; it may be too much of me talking out of my ass about instruments I don't understand for the serious apprentice of any wind or brass instrument; for the musically uninitiated, it may simply be too self-congratulatory.[^hindemith] Which leaves us with a net value of zero, and I didn't spend ten hours writing code for this page to be ultimately purposeless, so let's try to avoid that.

To avoid losing anyone, I'll do my best to tread the line between enthusiastically expounding on a topic and drowning in poeticisms. This should ultimately be accessible to all audiences, regardless of previous musical knowledge or any predisposition towards a certain instrument grouping.[^strings]

There are two general audiences whose presence I anticipate, and still more who I will not, so my prefaces will be allocated thusly:

***In the event*** that you're my hypothetical target audience, a student musician who's recently caught The Arranging Bug: you're in the right place! This manual is meant to explicate my perception of the intricacies of orchestration and my personal process of turning others' art into your own. I've written down tricks I've picked up about typesetting music, coming up with tempo markings, and recruiting musicians to play your piece. There's a whole psychological profile and political alignment chart for every instrument in the symphony, to peruse for your pleasure. As a disclaimer, my only authority rests on the couple of pieces[^six] I've written for CHS ensembles so far, and anyways music is an entirely subjective experience, so your mileage will vary on my interpretations of the finer points of instrumentation.

***In the event*** that you're Ms. Steinberg and you're grading this final project: please enjoy! I had a blast reflecting on all the things I've learned during my tenure here. I built this website myself because I really enjoy self-inflicted punishment, and for some reason staying up into the early hours of the morning debugging code is genuinely appealing to me.[^markdown] But it's also the ~~quickest~~ most interesting way to create a space that was wholly mine, down to the atom; from the visual design to the snappy footnotes to the code that makes the site tick, I've stretched every one of my technical skills in order to better express the art married to it. It seemed fitting that a work this personal should have my hand at every level of creation. I hope you have as good of a time reading this as I had writing it.

Finally, ***in the event*** that you're none of these people (or someone to whom I emailed this to prove that I did, in fact, have a reason for interrogating you on your political ideologies): welcome to 9 pages of food adjectives used to describe instrumental tonalities! There's a certain joy I take in incongruity, of which you'll see copious amounts of—coacervates[^coacervates] as moral lessons for chord building, flavors of La Croix[^lacroix] used to belittle middle school violinists. My world of music seeps into the fabric of life, stains with melody everything I perceive. This manual is part comedy hour and part practical knowledge, but mostly it's a love letter to my two-and-a-half years in this music program. It's a testament to the people I've been inspired by, a thesis on the things I've learned, and an attempt to—in some way—celebrate the immense amounts of help I've needed from the people around me to get to the places I've been and climb to the places I'll go.

Plentiful thank-yous are in order to Handley, Sophia, and Adam; I couldn't have written any of this without you guys.

[^hindemith]: Hindemith had a whole thing about who wouldn't like his book. It took like three pages and was overall just So Many more words than I really wanted to read about his specific target audience.

[^strings]: I'm going to use this space right now to admit that I primarily play viola and I'm grossly biased towards my section. When I write, I specifically account for the enjoyment of the viola section and I give a lot of credit to the tone that violas can produce, occasionally to the detriment of the violin II section. Writing for the Band Show and spending time with wind/brass players has allowed me to grasp the beauty and appeal of their world, but it remains that my attentions are focused--whether consciously or not--on the strings.

[^six]: Six!

[^markdown]: I originally wrote this entire framework in HTML, the skeleton of which you can still see in the [notanindex.html](https://github.com/kellywongs/composing/blob/master/notanindex.html) file that (for historical purposes, and foolishness) I'm not deleting from this Git repository. I ran into issue after issue with Javascript implementation and the projected difficulty of maintaining the site which, for the record, I forsaw when I started writing the code but ignored anyways. I complained about this all to my dad, a software developer who's been in love with Markdown for the last nine years. He suggested I migrate the entire site to Markdown. I muffled a scream because I knew he was right. Now I'm typing this from my Atom editor that I've altered to display code in sans-serif, things are easy to edit, Github-flavored Markdown is doing me a solid with built-in support for these footnote things, and life is great.

[^coacervates]: [Coacervates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coacervate) are little organic droplets that have their own lipid membranes and may have been life's earliest precursors. We did a lab with them in AP Biology, which was pretty much the highlight of my year (alternatively because I like playing God and/or molecular biology and cell evolution, take your pick). It's exhilarating to add acid to gelatin/gum arabic and watch it wriggle to proto-life. Distressingly, second period had a group (Grace Donnelly, Jacob Matiyevsky, and Aristotle Henderson) whose coacervates seemed to go beyond proto-life--they began to merge and consume each other, growing and changing, unsettling everybody who heard about it.

[^lacroix]: '[Pamplemousse](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pyekL%2BcnL.jpg)' flavored??????????????????? What does that taste like, if not a fluffy pink bathroom robe???

### b. Contents Held Forthwith

**Hello. You're all back.** Let's continue, then!

To me, the most intriguing compositional processes involve instrumentation, orchestration, and the overall enjoyment of the ensemble who plays it.[^computer] To this end, I'm starting this manual with a lengthy **[field guide to the orchestra](#ii-field-guide)**, which deals in mildly incongruous adjectives to deliver my sense of the personality tropes that define, guide, and strengthen each instrumental section. Of course, this also gets into questions of range, capability, and the overall playability of the part, so we'll discuss technical requirements and abilities at length.

I'll cover **[writing](#iii-writing)** and the more technical aspects of arranging for various ensembles in the middle section. Here we'll start getting into actual theory, which I don't have any formal education in, so I really don't anticipate it being comprehensive by any means. Since I've been raised in the string orchestra world, I have many a hot take on how to write for strings (*especially* how to write engaging viola parts; this is a direct attack on JW Pepper). Regarding brass and wind, I've written a couple parts and I've pestered a couple sources, but I'll readily accept that I haven't given them the same amount of precision as I have our string brethren. I have, as they say, clowned them. Sorry about that.

**[Typesetting](#iv-typesetting)** is the part that keeps me up till the early hours of dawn, so in an effort to help you through that pain, I've included a guide on how to make your music look professional (or, at least, not like your default open-source music notation program). There's some important things regarding how to notate certain things and how much freedom you get to really make your scores your own.

A lot of these lessons I've learned have come from **[pieces](#v-pieces)** I've had the privilege to write and perform here at Carmel: one for VAPA, five for the Band Show, all for a certain inexorable teacher whose presence impacts me still. I've written a little bit about each piece and what I took away from each, including burnout and how to find juice for your next incredible project.

To close, there's some **[closing words](#vi-closing-words)** on the best resources to tap here in Carmel, and general well-wishes regarding the current State Of The Music Program and the undertaking that is the Concert for Whitney. The music program here provides the fuel to all our compositional and arrangement adventures, and I can't wait to share it with you.

[^computer]: Computer scientists would call this top-down processing—where you're preeminently concerned with how the shipped product feels to the end user.

## ii. A Field Guide to the Orchestra

### a. Field Guide Introduction

**I find that everyone has an instrumental ‘vibe' to them**—some aspects of their being that match, occasionally to humorous effect, the personality and timbre of a certain instrument. For example, trumpet culture is dramatically different from violin I culture, for reasons too subjective to explain fully. Obviously, the personality stereotypes associated with each section are neither definitive nor concrete, as musicians hail from all walks of life and all temperaments. However, I maintain that there are salient characteristics in each instrument to which a certain brand of person is attracted, and anyways it's really fun to try and stereotype the phenomenon that is Orchestra Culture, so here we are.

There is, in fact, a purpose for such partitioning, humor and rehearsal boredom notwithstanding. For me, clever orchestration involves understanding the unique speaking styles of each instrument, physically *and* mentally; passages can be within the physical range of many instruments, but squarely in the emotional range of one.[^auxiliary] At the end of each section, I'll have a couple pointers on practical considerations regarding ranges and articulation limits and such, with a  special focus on the abilities of ensembles here at Carmel High. It's gonna be a fat section here, so hold on tight. We'll start our tour in the ensemble that I'm the most intimately familiar with, and save the kazoos for the end.

[^auxiliary]: This guide also has the auxiliary purpose of attempting to help you spot instrument players in the wild, should the need ever arise to defend yourself from one.

### b. Explanations

**Before we really get started,** though, I should probably explain some of the dichotomies I've used to loosely define every section on my massive moral alignment chart. This whole personality measurement started out as a joke to measure people, but eventually I realized that the stratifications could be easily extrapolated towards instruments.

#### Lawful vs. Chaotic:

**Lawful** describes the overall ability of the instrument to create an orthodox, orderly tone. Instruments that fall on this side of the continuum have a reputation of making sense, being pleasing to the ear, and having a calmness to their timbre. They frequently have leadership positions within the orchestra and often suffer from some degree of orchestral politics. [Flutists](#flutes) and [first violinists](#violins) are, by nature, more lawful than [trombonists](#trombones) and [violists](#violas).

**Chaotic** instruments are freer to experiment, produce a wilder sound, and are encouraged—by temperament or by section—to rebel in what ways they can. Their tonal qualities are more unusual than that of the lawful instruments. They fall into two extremes: those whose sound is inherently piercing (as in the case with the [piccolos](#piccolos) and [oboes](#oboes)), and those whose stereotype of demureness encourages memery within the section ([contrabass](#basses) and [clarinets](#clarinets)). Historically, they may have been sidelined in the orchestra in favor of their more palatable counterparts.[^violas]

On both ends, modern composers have started pushing the limits of the tones that these instruments can produce, discarding orthodoxy in favor of screaming clarinet solos[^rhapsody] and spicy viola chords[^schwanendreher]. It’s glorious.


#### Cronchy vs. Wet:

Here we’re getting into specific tonalities. An instrument rated cronchy produces a sterner, sharper sound than one rated wet. **Cronchiness** correlates with, but does not cause, the general disagreeableness of an instrument’s sound; **wetness** can easily lead to a flabby, weak tone if not harnessed properly by its player. When used correctly, both voices are crucial in an orchestra for blend and pizazz in their own right—cronchy instruments have a more distinct voice than wet instruments, but wet instruments are aural emollients. Contrast a [saxophone](#saxophones) with a [flute](#flutes), or a contrabass with a [violin](#violins).

#### Coarse vs. Majestic:

Along similar lines, a **majestic** instrument is thought of as being noble and soaring, billowy and brassy. **Coarse** instruments are rougher-voiced and more boisterous, dirty and jazzy and grounded. Take note that cronchy instruments (sterner and harder) are not necessarily coarse (exciting and filthy), and wet (smooth and edible) instruments will not always be majestic (clean and pompous). The [trumpets](#violas) are a notable example of an instrument that is both cronchy and majestic. There are fewer instruments that are wet and coarse, capable of slick dirtiness and easily-digestible jazz, but they exist— [clarinet](#clarinets) and [guitar](#guitars) come to mind.

#### Capitalist vs. Communist:

This is more of a culture-specific descriptor than anything to do with tonality. **Capitalist** sections are more political and hierarchical than **communist** sections, which tend to be much more laid-back in terms of seat placement and part assignment. In general, capitalism and communism correlate strongly with lawfulness/chaoticness and authoritarianism/liberalism (which we’ll discuss shortly).

#### Authoritarian vs. Liberal:

Describing something very similar to capitalism/communism, authoritarianism/liberalism rates the roles that a section tends to take in a piece (instead of the roles they take in an orchestra, as with capitalism/communism). **Authoritarian** instruments frequently dominate the tonal conversation through their range, timbre, and volume. They take prominent melodic lines in orchestration and rarely play second fiddle (haha) to their more liberal counterparts.

**Liberal** instruments

*Figure ii.c.2: String section moral alignment chart. Note the near-identical political alignments of the Violin I and Cello sections; contrast this with the dramatic differences between, but fundamental shared weaknesses of, Violin II and Viola.*

**I don’t want to sound biased,** but the string section as a whole is unrivaled in terms of emotional flexibility, range of coloration, and pyrotechnic capability.[^flex]  From the pared-down harmonies of a string quartet to the expansive lushness of a string orchestra, string players are capable of producing almost any imaginable sound. Of course, they need their brass and wind colleagues to add the spark and extremes of emotions that the strings just can’t produce on their own, but for the most part their capability for diversity and dynamism makes them a compelling choice for almost any ensemble.

You’ll notice that the above political alignment chart can’t seem to fit the string section across any dichotomy. Overall, they’re neither lawful nor chaotic, majestic nor coarse; they can’t even decide if they’re good or evil. In music, similarly, the strings play every imaginable role and sing every imaginable part. They’re particularly good at swells of power, saccharine-sweet passages, and mediating the field of timbres between the other members of the symphony. Their primary weaknesses, especially at a younger age, are an inability to play without vibrato—to collectively produce a pure tone akin to that of the horns, which is theoretically possible—and a general abundance of schmultz.

The melodies that bounce around in my head are translated into the diverse language of a string orchestra first and foremost—bubbly pizzicatos, ghostly *col legno* passages, the intense visual spectacle of an orchestra lifting their bows at the same time. In the last couple of months, I’ve gotten better at assigning parts to wind and brass instruments, but it remains that the techniques known to string players are the ones that I imagine most often.

[^flex]: The latter flex can also be taken quite literally if necessary.

*Figure ii.c.3: A moral alignment chart for all  possible violin sections.*

##### i. personality

**You may be a violinist** if you’re slightly fragile, moderately self-deprecating, and have extreme reactions to caffeine. There are generally two divisions of violinists in any orchestra, the violins I and II; occasionally (with Bach and distrustful grade-school arrangers in equal measure) you get a violin III section. No one likes talking about the violin IIIs, but it’s a section nevertheless, so as it stands we’ve got ourselves three very diverse personality types on one instrument.

***First violinists:*** First violinists often fall into two physical archetypes, both of which seem so well-suited to the instrument that it may as well be destiny.

Archetype the first: spindly and proportionally fluffy, enamored with dank memes, an Android user; they’re relaxed until they’re not, after which they’re stormy and melodramatic like a Beethoven middle movement incarnate. Whether they’re comfortable discussing their chair placement varies wildly on a day-to-day basis, but as with most first violinists, it’s best to leave this question a wide berth.

The second type of first violinist is small enough to bunch up their legs when they play. They’re easily angered and are invariably in a higher math class than you. (This kind has an iPhone and an infrequently-updated Snapchat account.) They’re into memes, too, but they’re of the purer variety—they are, after all, cat people. This type is the kind to drink three espresso shots as part of their morning routine, and then show up at rehearsal buzzing with frenetic energy.

How many AP classes these kids take typically has an inverse relationship with how much they care about being concertmaster, but take care to exercise caution regardless; nowhere are the first-chair politics more cutthroat than in the first violin section.

***Second violinists:*** We come across more diversity and relaxation as we move left, entering the realm of the second violinists.
