## i. Introduction

### a. Preface

**First of all,** I'd like to extend my dearest condolences to anyone who happens upon this manual. It may be too abstract and lighthearted for the seeker of practical knowledge; it may be too much of me talking out of my ass about instruments I don't understand for the serious apprentice of any wind or brass instrument; for the musically uninitiated, it may simply be too self-congratulatory.[^hindemith] Which leaves us with a net value of zero, and I didn't spend ten hours writing code for this page to be ultimately purposeless, so let's try to avoid that.

To avoid losing anyone, I'll do my best to tread the line between enthusiastically expounding on a topic and drowning in poeticisms. This should ultimately be accessible to all audiences, regardless of previous musical knowledge or any predisposition towards a certain instrument grouping.[^strings]

There are two general audiences whose presence I anticipate, and still more who I will not, so my prefaces will be allocated thusly:

***In the event*** that you're my hypothetical target audience, a student musician who's recently caught The Arranging Bug: you're in the right place! This manual is meant to explicate my perception of the intricacies of orchestration and my personal process of turning others' art into your own. I've written down tricks I've picked up about typesetting music, coming up with tempo markings, and recruiting musicians to play your piece. There's a whole psychological profile and political alignment chart for every instrument in the symphony, to peruse for your pleasure. As a disclaimer, my only authority rests on the couple of pieces[^six] I've written for CHS ensembles so far, and anyways music is an entirely subjective experience, so your mileage will vary on my interpretations of the finer points of instrumentation.

***In the event*** that you're Ms. Steinberg and you're grading this final project: please enjoy! I had a blast reflecting on all the things I've learned during my tenure here. I built this website myself because I really enjoy self-inflicted punishment, and for some reason staying up into the early hours of the morning debugging code is genuinely appealing to me.[^markdown] But it's also the ~~quickest~~ most interesting way to create a space that was wholly mine, down to the atom; from the visual design to the snappy footnotes to the code that makes the site tick, I've stretched every one of my technical skills in order to better express the art married to it. It seemed fitting that a work this personal should have my hand at every level of creation. I hope you have as good of a time reading this as I had writing it.

Finally, ***in the event*** that you're none of these people (or someone to whom I emailed this to prove that I did, in fact, have a reason for interrogating you on your political ideologies): welcome to 9 pages of food adjectives used to describe instrumental tonalities! There's a certain joy I take in incongruity, of which you'll see copious amounts of—coacervates[^coacervates] as moral lessons for chord building, flavors of La Croix[^lacroix] used to belittle middle school violinists. My world of music seeps into the fabric of life, stains with melody everything I perceive. This manual is part comedy hour and part practical knowledge, but mostly it's a love letter to my two-and-a-half years in this music program. It's a testament to the people I've been inspired by, a thesis on the things I've learned, and an attempt to—in some way—celebrate the immense amounts of help I've needed from the people around me to get to the places I've been and climb to the places I'll go.

Plentiful thank-yous are in order to Handley, Sophia, and Adam; I couldn't have written any of this without you guys.

[^hindemith]: Hindemith had a whole thing about who wouldn't like his book. It took like three pages and was overall just So Many more words than I really wanted to read about his specific target audience.

[^strings]: I'm going to use this space right now to admit that I primarily play viola and I'm grossly biased towards my section. When I write, I specifically account for the enjoyment of the viola section and I give a lot of credit to the tone that violas can produce, occasionally to the detriment of the violin II section. Writing for the Band Show and spending time with wind/brass players has allowed me to grasp the beauty and appeal of their world, but it remains that my attentions are focused--whether consciously or not--on the strings.

[^six]: Six!

[^markdown]: I originally wrote this entire framework in HTML, the skeleton of which you can still see in the [notanindex.html](https://github.com/kellywongs/composing/blob/master/notanindex.html) file that (for historical purposes, and foolishness) I'm not deleting from this Git repository. I ran into issue after issue with Javascript implementation and the projected difficulty of maintaining the site which, for the record, I forsaw when I started writing the code but ignored anyways. I complained about this all to my dad, a software developer who's been in love with Markdown for the last nine years. He suggested I migrate the entire site to Markdown. I muffled a scream because I knew he was right. Now I'm typing this from my Atom editor that I've altered to display code in sans-serif, things are easy to edit, Github-flavored Markdown is doing me a solid with built-in support for these footnote things, and life is great.

[^coacervates]: [Coacervates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coacervate) are little organic droplets that have their own lipid membranes and may have been life's earliest precursors. We did a lab with them in AP Biology, which was pretty much the highlight of my year (alternatively because I like playing God and/or molecular biology and cell evolution, take your pick). It's exhilarating to add acid to gelatin/gum arabic and watch it wriggle to proto-life. Distressingly, second period had a group (Grace Donnelly, Jacob Matiyevsky, and Aristotle Henderson) whose coacervates seemed to go beyond proto-life--they began to merge and consume each other, growing and changing, unsettling everybody who heard about it.

[^lacroix]: '[Pamplemousse](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pyekL%2BcnL.jpg)' flavored??????????????????? What does that taste like, if not a fluffy pink bathroom robe???

### b. Contents Held Forthwith

**Hello. You're all back.** Let's continue, then!

To me, the most intriguing compositional processes involve instrumentation, orchestration, and the overall enjoyment of the ensemble who plays it.[^computer] To this end, I'm starting this manual with a lengthy **[field guide to the orchestra](#ii-field-guide)**, which deals in mildly incongruous adjectives to deliver my sense of the personality tropes that define, guide, and strengthen each instrumental section. Of course, this also gets into questions of range, capability, and the overall playability of the part, so we'll discuss technical requirements and abilities at length.

I'll cover **[writing](#iii-writing)** and the more technical aspects of arranging for various ensembles in the middle section. Here we'll start getting into actual theory, which I don't have any formal education in, so I really don't anticipate it being comprehensive by any means. Since I've been raised in the string orchestra world, I have many a hot take on how to write for strings (*especially* how to write engaging viola parts; this is a direct attack on JW Pepper). Regarding brass and wind, I've written a couple parts and I've pestered a couple sources, but I'll readily accept that I haven't given them the same amount of precision as I have our string brethren. I have, as they say, clowned them. Sorry about that.

**[Typesetting](#iv-typesetting)** is the part that keeps me up till the early hours of dawn, so in an effort to help you through that pain, I've included a guide on how to make your music look professional (or, at least, not like your default open-source music notation program). There's some important things regarding how to notate certain things and how much freedom you get to really make your scores your own.

A lot of these lessons I've learned have come from **[pieces](#v-pieces)** I've had the privilege to write and perform here at Carmel: one for VAPA, five for the Band Show, all for a certain inexorable teacher whose presence impacts me still. I've written a little bit about each piece and what I took away from each, including burnout and how to find juice for your next incredible project.

To close, there's some **[closing words](#vi-closing-words)** on the best resources to tap here in Carmel, and general well-wishes regarding the current State Of The Music Program and the undertaking that is the Concert for Whitney. The music program here provides the fuel to all our compositional and arrangement adventures, and I can't wait to share it with you.

[^computer]: Computer scientists would call this top-down processing—where you're preeminently concerned with how the shipped product feels to the end user.
